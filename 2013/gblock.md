talks: [{ title: "Keynote: Open source at Microsoft - Fighting the good fight", abstract: "For the past 6 years, I've been at Microsoft pushing the bar on Open Source. Early on that meant plenty of scars. The last few years however we've seen tremendous change: we're sharing our source, we're using others' source, we're designing intentionally to support OSS stacks including mono, node.js and PHP, and we're taking contributions. In this talk I'll describe how we're making OSS work. I'll share my own experiences (and horror stories), and describe how OSS teams operate at Microsoft.", link: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/k9Hz8YTTVD4" }, { title: "GET hyper about hypermedia with ASP.NET Web API", abstract: "Building hypermedia systems these days is all the rage. Those who achieve building hypermedia systems are promised fame, success and mountains of riches. OK that’s not true! But hypermedia does help you to build systems where the client and server can evolve somewhat independently, and that is a big deal. Come this talk and we’ll deep dive into exactly what hypermedia is and different ways to achieve building hypermedia driven systems with ASP.NET Web API. We'll look at different media types that use Hypermedia including HAL and Collection+JSON, libraries in ASP.NET that support them and how to string it all together.", link: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/vp-Na5wKlig" }]
