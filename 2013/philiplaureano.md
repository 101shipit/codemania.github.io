talks: [{ title: "Learn System.Reflection.* the Hard Way", abstract: "Have you ever wondered what System.Reflection looks like under the hood? In this session, we will dive deep into the heart of a .NET assembly, and compare the System.Reflection API to the actual metadata that lies underneath it--and the results might just surprise you. I'll also talk about the lessons that I learned from building a CLR Reflection API from scratch, as well as talk about the future of metaprogramming in .NET beyond just IL manipulation, and how it might affect everyone who uses the CLR itself.", link: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_5PnWt0Gxo' }]
