talks: [{ title: "All your brains suck", abstract: "Humans. As a species, we suck. The only real evolutionary advantage we have is our brains, and by using them we've become the dominant species on the planet. Our brains are superbly adapted for our survival and success in the environment in which they evolved... the African savanna 200,000 years ago.
