# Codemania Conversations

### Saturday 2nd - Sunday 3rd April, 2016

Codemania speakers are world-renowned technologists; global leaders in their respective fields... but you only get 40 minutes of them, right? Well this year - you have a unique opportunity to hang out with our superstar speakers and your fellow attendees to truly enjoy the full Codemania experience...

Codemania conversations is a 2-day unconference held in a secret location (within an easy drive of Auckland CBD), where, as one of a strictly limited number of codemaniacs, you will be able to draw up your own agenda and debate the topics that matter to you:

- Something you learnt at the conference, you want to dig deeper?
- Something you want to share with your peers about a technology?
- Something you want to learn more about?

A regular ticket for Codemania Conversations lets you attend both Saturday and Sunday during the day. A Weekender ticket includes overnight luxury accomodation, dinner, breakfast, and almost certainly some shenanigans. There are literally only a handful of Weekender tickets available, so as the kids say: act quickly.
