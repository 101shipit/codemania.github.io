# Agenda


## Friday 1st April, 2016

### Codemania

This is not a prank. We really are running New Zealand's premier software conference by developers for developers on April Fool's day. Lucky no-one here's superstitious, right?

The exact agenda will be available here in the near future, but you know what Codemania is: It's a full day of in-depth talks across the spectrum of platforms, languages and technologies.

We don't care if it's web, mobile, front-end, back-end, cloud, .NET, JVM, OO or FP. If it's about improving the world through software, then our world-class line up of globally recognised speakers will be talking about it.


## Saturday 2nd - Sunday 3rd April, 2016

### Codemania Conversations

Codemania speakers are world-renowned technologists; global leaders in their respective fields... but you only get 40 minutes of them, right? Well this year - you have a unique opportunity to hang out with our speakers and your fellow attendees to truly enjoy the full Codemania experience...

Codemania conversations is a 2-day unconference held at the stunningly picturesque Waitakere Estate, where a strictly limited number of codemaniacs will be able to draw up your own agenda and debate the topics that matter to you:

- Something you learnt at the conference, you want to dig deeper?
- Something you want to share with your peers about a technology?
- Something you want to learn more about?
