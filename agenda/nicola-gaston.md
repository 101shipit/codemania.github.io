speakerBio: Dr Nicola Gaston is Deputy Director of the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, a New Zealand Centre of Research Excellence.  Her group has worked extensively on quantum-mechanical simulations of the melting behaviour of metal nanoparticles, which has developed our fundamental understanding of the low melting temperature of gallium.  They are currently focused on methods for the theoretical description of 'superatoms'; nanoscale atomic mimics made out of metal clusters of atoms, which exhibit quantum size effects and can act as building blocks for nanostructured materials with designer properties.  She has been the President of the New Zealand Association of Scientists for the past two years.

talkTitle: The limits of reductionism (and why we should think about this in the computational sciences)
talkBlurb: "<p>Nanoscience is full of examples of emergence: collective properties that cannot be simply explained by the behaviour of an individual component. The concept of a superatom is used in nanoscience to describe an assembly of hundreds of atoms that is able to behave like an individual atom. I'll discuss the work we are doing in studying materials made from superatoms, with emphasis on the algorithmic reduction of the problem into smaller problems, suited to highly parallel computing.</p><p>Emergent behaviours are hard to explain within standard paradigms of materials science, and this points to a failure of reductionism in science: breaking things down to smaller and smaller components does not always provide more insight.  As someone who relies on computational models for highly parallel computing that are inherently reductionist, I'll try to explain what we can learn from the limits of reductionism, and why this matters for how we write and use code (and other things).</p>"
