talkTitle: DevOps&#58; Learning how to go fast without tripping over the cables
talkBlurb: <p>When the plan is to do more, and do it more often, the new DevOps religion can help you break free from those miserable shackles of yesterday's death march. But how can you move fast without turning things into a giant game of drunken bullrush?</p><p>Since joining Pushpay I can't really remember a slow day but neither can I remember a day when I felt like things were out of control. We'll discuss some of the things we've learned and how we manage to do it without tripping over the cables.</p>
