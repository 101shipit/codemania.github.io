talkTitle: Putting the Dev in Devops
talkBlurb: For much of its history, a lot of devops has been focused on bringing operational thinking to developers, whether that be giving them deployment powers with the magic of containers in the cloud, or giving them the responsibilities of an on-call rotation. Less has been done to bring development thinking to operations, and may ops engineers or sysadmins seem to pride themselves on only writing code that consists of incomprehensible perl or bash. At Etsy, we have a suite of tools we’ve developed to manage the provisioning of servers in our data centers, but this code was all written by ops people and grew organically over time, turning out to be functional but also messy and fragile. In this talk, I’ll go over what I’ve done to bring software engineering practices to this operational tooling, discussing improvements like adding testability, refactoring to make the code easier to understand and modify, and adding real functional testing and deployment processes.
