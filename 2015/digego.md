talks: [{ title: "A Programmer's Guide to Western Music", abstract: "Sure to be entertaining, possibly even informative, A Programmer's Guide to Western Music will take the audience on a whirlwind tour of Western Music through the ages.  From gregorian chant to 20th Century serialism, Andrew will tease apart how music works, from a systems perspective. And if this doesn't sound hardcore enough for you this musical tour will be live-coded in Andrew's own, super high performance, DSP smashing, cyberphysical programming language - Extempore.  From the opening cadence to the final resolution A Programmer's Guide is a story of code, told through music.", link: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpSYWd_aIiI' }]
