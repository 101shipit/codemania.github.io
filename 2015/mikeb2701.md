talks: [{ title: "Designing for Performance - A Case Study", abstract: "What if you were told tomorrow that your system needs to handle 100,000s of transactions per second on a single node?  Store and index terabytes of data?  Present and visualise that data to users in real-time?  How would you tackle such a problem, and would you approach it any differently to software projects that you'd tackled in the past?</p><p>In this talk I will present a case study based on an application that had very similar requirements and attempt to show that the core principals needed for building software with challenging throughput and latency requirements should be no different those used when building any other software.  Core principals like, having a knowledge the problem domain, understanding the costs of the various design options and picking a solution that best fits the problems.</p><p>Throughout the case study, we'll delve into multiple software layers and examine fast data storage, how to best leverage that caches you already have, responsive UI design and why when it comes to distributed systems we should be thinking protocols not APIs.", link: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/' }]
