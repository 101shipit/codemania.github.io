talks: [{ title: "Fast Delivery with Microservices", abstract: "Companies of all sizes and backgrounds are having to deal with the transition to a world where software development is central to their existence and competitiveness. To deliver software products at high velocity requires four things. First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled micro services architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured 'big data' analytics gets answers quickly, docker and cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and a DevOps organization structure removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment.", link: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tvJu5xSOqTw' }]
