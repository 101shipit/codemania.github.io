talks: [{ title: "The Operable Front End", abstract: "With the rise of single-page apps, increased use of ajax navigation, and an ever-expanding set of browser APIs, web applications have changed, moving more and more functionality client-side. But many of us still have dashboards that represent the entire client experience with a single page load time graph.</p><p>This talk will take a look at the state of real user monitoring in the browser and dig deep into exactly _what_ you can track client side. Then we'll look dig into some production situations and see what we can learn about performance, security, and user behavior when we improve our monitoring and configure our app to be more operable.", link: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/' }]
