talkTitle: Refactoring the Dinosaur
talkBlurb: The hardware world has historically been a mysterious, fragmented land of cryptic code. By leveraging the strengths of NodeJS, old tools and libraries can be greatly improved when rewritten in JavaScript. Keeping this in mind, how do you even go about refactoring a fossilized piece of software while still preserving your sanity? Why even do this?<br/><br/>To answer these questions, we’ll dig into a case study, showing how you can create a modern, JavaScript-powered interface for users to program your device. You’ll take away lessons on how to ensure the tools you create can deliver a delightful user experience to both end users and fellow developers. Preferably without bricking any microchips along the way!
