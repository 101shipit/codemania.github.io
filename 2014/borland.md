talks: [{ title: "Understanding C++ templates", abstract: "Templates are a key feature of C++. They enable you to write safer code with less duplication and better performance. Almost all C++ programmers have encountered them, but few know them well. Orion will show you how to think about and put to use some of the more advanced things you can do with templates, and show that they're simpler than you might think.</p><p>Even if you're not a C++ developer, understanding these concepts will give you a better perspective for programming in other languages.", link: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlYbgYDdY38' }]
