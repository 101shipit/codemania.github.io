talks: [{ title: "Comonads, Applicative Functors, Monads and Other Principled Things", abstract: "In this talk, we will discuss what these concepts represent and how they apply in everyday programming practices. A concrete explanation of the meaning and motivation for each of these will be provided â€” no metaphors or handwaving. Some of the practical consequences will be introduced by drawing on the ubiquitous knowledge of everyday programmers.</p><p>The audience should expect to walk away with an introductory understanding and vocabulary for these topics with a capability to directly apply this knowledge in any programming environment and an aspiration to take this knowledge further.", link: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8yg6J9basE' }]
