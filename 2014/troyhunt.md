talks: [{ title: "Hack yourself first: go on the cyber-offence before online attackers do", abstract: "The prevalence of online attacks against websites has accelerated quickly recently and the same risks continue to be exploited. However, these are often easily identified directly within the browser; it’s just a matter of understanding the vulnerable patterns to look for.</p><p></p><p>'Hack Yourself First' is all about developers building up cyber-offence skills and proactively seeking out security vulnerabilities in their own websites before an attacker does. It recognises that we have huge volumes of existing websites that haven’t gone through sufficient security review plus we continue to create new content that even when built with security in mind, still needs testing from the perspective of a cybercriminal.</p><p></p><p>In this session we’ll look at website security from the attacker’s perspective and exploit common risks in a vulnerable web application. We’ll also explore ways to easily grab credit cards, gain immediate FTP access to thousands of websites and even look at how your toilet can be pwned.", link: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_tWyqaQ2Jk' }]
