talks: [{ title: "Improve Web Perf Without Breaking Metrics", abstract: "Using off-the-shelf tools to understand web performance worked really well for me for a while. But when I shipped a javascript-based experience for tablets, the off-the-shelf tools fell over, disastrously.</p><p>We've gradually stopped refreshing the page on every click, and we've become progressively blind about the performance of our websites. We ended up creating our own unelaborate way of getting metrics, hoping that soon the tools will notice that ajax and pjax and turbo links are real things.</p><p>This is the story of what went wrong, how we 'solved' it, and how it changed how I measure performance.</p><p></p><p>There will be science.", link: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/QDGdSMMAX9c' }]
