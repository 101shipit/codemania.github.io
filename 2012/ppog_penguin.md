talks: [{ title: "How to Not Write a For Loop", abstract: "Simple, reliable and concise: thanks to languages like F# and Scala, and features like LINQ and lambdas, object-oriented programmers are increasingly able to take advantage of functional programming techniques and tools. But to get the most out of functional programming you need to change your mindset, to think in terms of functional idioms rather than just translating your imperative code into a new syntax. Learn some of the most important basic idioms, and see how they make your code smaller, safer and simpler!" }]
