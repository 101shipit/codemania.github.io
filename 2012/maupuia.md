speakerName: Mike Brown
speakerBio: "Mike is a co-founder of Webstock, Lil Regie and FullCodePress.</p><p>He is not the astronomer who killed Pluto or the head coach of the LA Lakers. This is as much a disappointment to him as he's sure it is to you!</p><p>A fan of Bob Dylan, red wine and cycle touring, he lives in a house with sea views with his lovely wife and two children. He's old enough to remember building websites with nested layout tables 6 levels deep."

talks: [{ title: "We're alone, we're screwed and you have to live your life over and over and over again. Like, for eternity", abstract: "What implications do the size of the universe, climate change, the global financial crisis and Nietzsche have for the way we live our lives and do our jobs?</p><p>Mike explores this very question! He argues that for those working in the web and IT industries, with the greater power we're gaining over HOW THINGS WORK, comes a greater responsibility to NOT BE AN ASSHOLE.." }]
