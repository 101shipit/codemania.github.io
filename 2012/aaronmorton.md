talks: [{ title: "Cassandra Does What?", abstract: "Apache Cassandra is a scalable, distributed, fault tolerant cluster database used by sites such as Twitter, Netflix and Urban Airship. This session will cover how data is distributed, fault tolerance, eventual consistency, read repair, hinted handoff, anti-entrophy, distributed deletes, column oriented data model and the read and write paths. By the end you'll have a good idea about how Cassandra is different to a traditional RDBMS and why it can make your life easier." }]
