talks: [{ title: "Lessons from Mobile", abstract: "Mobile has been around for a while, but now it's all about the post-App Store world. For 40 minutes, while balancing the proverbial bowl of fruit on his head, Karl will recount his dark-days as an enthusiastic J2ME developer, and then compare (and contrast) his current outlook: dropping anecdotes like nachos; exploring what has changed in the last 4 years and the lessons we take away to improve all our software development practice." }]
